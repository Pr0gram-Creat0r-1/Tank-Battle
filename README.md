# Tank Battle Simulator
A simple tkinter game.

Note: The "tanks" are supposed to resemble [DJI's Robomaster S1](https://www.dji.com/robomaster-s1).

This game is still in development. Different versions may come out soon, but for now, just stick with this one.

Instructions:
1. Arrow keys to move
2. Space key to fire (you can only fire forward)
3. Destroy the other tank
4. Press q to activate/deactivate a personal shield. You cannot fire if your shield is on.
5. Have fun!

Game Sounds and Music:
1. Game music: Legend of Zelda Breath of the Wild Shrine Battle Music (downloaded from here)
2. Used winsound.Beep() for the "3 2 1 go" part at the beginning.
3. Minecraft "oof" sound for when you or the enemy gets hit (downloaded from here).
4. Explosion sound (download here) for when your HP or the enemy's reaches 0.

Additional Notes:
1. There's a glitch where if your shield is on and you're facing one way (left or right) and you press the key to move in the opposite direction, the shield automatically deactivates. Press q again to reactivate it, and just be careful not to get shot.
2. New versions of the game may come out soon :)
