#Tank Battle
How to play:
1. Download zip folder
2. Unzip it
3. Use "import Tank_Battle_Simulator" in your python shell, or do some other method by using your command line.

Instructions:
1. Arrow keys to move
2. Space key to fire (you can only fire forward)
3. Press q to activate/deactivate a personal shield. You cannot fire if your shield is on.
4. Destroy the other tank to win.

Game Sounds and Music (links will take you to the sites where I downloaded them from):
1. [Game music: Legend of Zelda Breath of the Wild Shrine Battle Music](https://downloads.khinsider.com/game-soundtracks/album/legend-of-zelda-the-breath-of-the-wild-original-soundtrack/1-09.%2520Battle%2520%2528Shrine%2529-%2520Original%2520Soundtrack%2520Ver..mp3)
2. [Minecraft "oof" sound for when you or the enemy gets hit](https://orangefreesounds.com/minecraft-death-sound/)
3. [Explosion sound for when your HP or the enemy's reaches 0](https://www.zapsplat.com/music/double-large-explosions-with-some-very-light-distortion/)
4. [Star Wars blaster sound for when you or the enemy shoots](https://soundbible.com/470-Laser-Blaster.html)
5. [winsound.Beep() for the "3 2 1 go" part at the beginning](https://docs.python.org/3/library/winsound.html)

Additional Notes:
1. There's a glitch where if your shield is on and you're facing one way (left or right) and you press the key to move in the opposite direction, the shield automatically deactivates. Press q again to reactivate it, and just be careful not to get shot. (EDIT: fixed now).
2. The "tanks" are supposed to resemble [DJI's Robomaster S1](https://www.dji.com/robomaster-s1).
3. New versions and edits of the game may come out soon :)
4. Any suggestions, questions, or comments are welcome.
5. And, as always, have fun!
